* Char recovery (port it from mangos)

* Outdoor PvP (add wrapper and outdoor pvp data saving to characters database + reset times).

* Game event system - event spawn data should be exluded from original spawns)

* Creature difficulty stats

* Weekly quests

* Monthly quests

* Ingame loterry (its blizzlike thing, for e.x NPC Ian Drake)

* Force quests data to use dbc reputation values instead of custom (also create additional quest_rewards table for custom value - we should allow customizing it!)

* Remove worldmap_info tables generally and force to use dbc values.

* Split characters table

* Force logon to use sha1 password.

* Remove possible hack code, magic numbers.

* Add debug information to every packet.

* Add info to database data load functions - 70% complete.

* Map, dbc, vmap extractors should get external class functions wrappers - its not good in code style to contain single functions for big apps in following row.

* Crashdumps should create text crashdump about crash (it would make possible to make mingw support) and move MSVC debug construction in this library.

* Add proper mingw, clang, intel compilers support - important.

* Move cmake to top folders (that would add great support for lower popularity UNIX IDES like anjuta) - low priority
