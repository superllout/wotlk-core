How to contribute
Generally:

    Respect current developers, contributors - they do hard work and shares it for free.

    Use English - we want hear you but we may won't understand your custom language.

    We do not promise anything, when its done - its done.

    Do not impale community with any products, advertisements, commercial activity or similar - do it personally, this community was not created for that purpose.

For simple user:

    Report any issues with proper information (last used core commit hash, git branch, compiler, platform, mysql server version, add-ons, which script engines are enabled and similar.).

    Add information when creating issue how that functionality should work (for example: creature should cast XX spell XXX times) and how this works in core currently.

    Check your information and for duplicate issues before submitting.

    By testing new patches (major implementation will published in branches) and reporting implementation issues.

    Helping to keep it well documented.

    By making guides.

For developer:

    Improve performance and compatibility where It is possible (major).

    Make pull requests with code improvements. Do not make pull requests with fun content to core repository.

    Make code understandable, do not use just letters or non understandable, long variable titles, use spaces instead of tabs and try to use much latest supportable (currently c11/c++11) standards, add comments which could help to understand code easer

    Implement features, script missing contents, improve functionality where is possible.
